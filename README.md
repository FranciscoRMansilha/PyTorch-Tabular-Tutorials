## Leveraging Deep Learning Architectures for Tabular Data Problems

![Alt text](data/banner.jpg)

In this repository, I share a series of notebook tutorials on how to use PyTorch Tabular to solve tabular data tasks like classification and regression.

**Note:** These are **not** the official package tutorials.

### Why follow these tutorials?

The official PyTorch Tabular tutorials cover a wide range of advanced topics in great detail, but they can be challenging for beginners. I try to design my tutorials to be more accessible, using Kaggle datasets and providing clear comparisons with traditional machine learning models and approaches. These tutorials are tailored for those starting with tabular data and looking to gradually explore deep learning techniques.

## Tutorials

Currently, I have the first tutorial available:

1. **PyTorch Tabular Basics**

   This tutorial introduces the basics of how the PyTorch Tabular package works by solving a regression problem using a Kaggle dataset. It also provides a comparison with traditional machine learning models.

More tutorials will be added soon! ðŸ˜€
